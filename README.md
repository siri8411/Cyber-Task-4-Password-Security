# Task 4 – Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Objective
To understand how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected.

## Concepts Covered
- Hashing vs Encryption
- Hash Types (MD5, SHA, bcrypt)
- Password attacks
- MFA importance

## Analysis
Weak passwords are vulnerable to dictionary and brute force attacks.
Strong hashing algorithms and MFA significantly improve security.

## Outcome
This task improved understanding of password security and authentication defenses.
